# Hacktoberfest
* Hacktoberfest is a program by Digital Ocean and Github, where you can easily win a T-shirt just by making pull requests (between 1st       October to 31st October) to any open source projects on Github.
* Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in Github's global community.
* Whether you’re a seasoned contributor or looking for projects to contribute to for the first time, you’re welcome to participate.
* You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31. Just be sure to sign up on the official Hacktoberfest website for your Pull     requests to count.
* This year(2018), to get a T-shirt, you must make five pull requests (PRs) between October 1–31 in any timezone and the first 50,000 can   earn a T-shirt (compared with 30,000 in 2017).
